\section{User-Centered Design Principles}
\subsection{Understanding the Target Population}
Developing digital health applications for Alzheimer's patients requires a deep understanding of the target population's characteristics, needs, and limitations. This understanding should inform all aspects of the application's design and functionality.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cognitive Considerations}: Memory deficits, attention limitations, executive dysfunction, language impairment, and visuospatial difficulties are common in Alzheimer's disease and vary in severity across disease stages.
    
    \item \textbf{Physical Considerations}: Fine motor control issues, visual impairments, and hearing loss are common comorbidities in the elderly population.
    
    \item \textbf{Technology Literacy}: Many older adults have limited experience with digital technologies, affecting their ability to navigate and use applications.
    
    \item \textbf{Environmental Factors}: Consider where and how the application will be used, including potential assistance from caregivers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stakeholder Engagement}
Effective digital health applications engage multiple stakeholders throughout the design and development process:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Patients}: Primary users whose needs and preferences should drive design decisions.
    
    \item \textbf{Caregivers}: Often critical facilitators of application use who may also be direct users.
    
    \item \textbf{Healthcare Providers}: May recommend, prescribe, or integrate the application into clinical care.
    
    \item \textbf{Technical Experts}: Provide insights on technical feasibility and implementation.
    
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Experts}: Guide compliance with relevant regulations.
\end{itemize}

        \item Avoid complex patterns or distracting backgrounds
        \item Use consistent layout and navigation elements
        \item Incorporate recognizable icons alongside text labels
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Interaction Design}:

    \item \textbf{Memory Prompts}: Provide contextual cues to aid recall
    \item \textbf{Scaffolded Navigation}: Guide users through a structured process
    \item \textbf{Recognition Over Recall}: Use visual cues and multiple-choice options instead of requiring free recall
    \item \textbf{Personalization}: Allow customization of content and interface based on individual preferences and abilities
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Difficulty}: Adjust the complexity of interactions based on user performance
    \item \textbf{Error Prevention}: Design interfaces that minimize the possibility of error
    \item \textbf{Multimodal Inputs and Outputs}: Support various ways of entering and receiving information (text, voice, images)
